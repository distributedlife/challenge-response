# The inch Framework
This repository is just one part of the icnh game framework. I wanted a modularised game framework (like [voxel.js](http://voxeljs.com) or [crtrdg](http://crtrdg.com/) but one that follows my needs as a game developer. I’m sure it’s even possible to mix and match the modules from the above into the inch framework.
